BUY VS RENT DECISION RULES

1. Rule Based on Years of Stay:
   - If buyer plans to stay less than 3 years → Renting is better.
   - If buyer plans to stay more than 5 years → Buying is better.
   - Between 3–5 years → Decision depends on income, EMI stress, rent cost, and liquidity.

2. Monthly Rent vs EMI Comparison:
   - If EMI is significantly higher than rent, buying becomes harder unless long stay is planned.
   - If EMI ≈ rent, buying is often better for long-term wealth.

3. Upfront Cost Consideration:
   - Buying requires large upfront costs (≈ 7% of property price).
   - If the buyer cannot comfortably pay upfront costs → Renting is safer.

4. Liquidity Check:
   - Buyer should have emergency savings after paying the down payment.
   - If down payment drains all savings → Renting is safer.

5. EMI-to-Income Ratio:
   - <30% → Comfortable to buy.
   - 30–50% → Borderline; depends on stability of income.
   - >50% → Not advisable to buy; EMI stress is high.

6. Market Stability:
   - Rising rent + stable property prices → Buying is better.
   - Falling property prices + high interest → Renting may be safer.

7. Lifestyle Flexibility:
   - Buying locks the buyer into the property.
   - Renting gives flexibility to move or upgrade homes.

SUMMARY HEURISTIC:
- Short stay + high EMI stress + low liquidity → Rent.
- Long stay + comfortable EMI + enough savings → Buy.
