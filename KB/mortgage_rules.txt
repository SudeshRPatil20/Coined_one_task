GENERAL UAE MORTGAGE RULES

1. Loan-to-Value (LTV) for Expat Buyers:
   - Minimum down payment required is 20% of the property price.
   - Banks typically finance a maximum of 80% of the property value.

2. Mortgage Tenure:
   - Maximum mortgage tenure allowed for expats is 25 years.
   - Shorter tenures result in higher EMI but lower total interest.

3. Interest Rates:
   - Typical mortgage interest rate in UAE for expats is between 3.5% and 5.0%.
   - For calculators, assume a standard rate of 4.5% unless otherwise specified.

   - Dubai Land Department (DLD) Fees: 4% of property value.
   - Registration Trustee Fee: ~AED 4,000.
   - Mortgage Registration Fee: ~0.25% of loan amount.
   - Bank processing fees: ~1% of loan amount.
   - Estimated total upfront cost ≈ 7% of property price.

5. Income-to-EMI Affordability (DTI rule):
   - Banks prefer that EMI should not exceed 50% of the borrower’s monthly income.
   - EMI-to-income ratio > 0.5 is high risk.
   - EMI-to-income ratio between 0.3–0.5 is borderline.
   - EMI-to-income ratio < 0.3 is considered comfortable.

6. Early Settlement:
   - Many UAE banks charge up to 1% of outstanding loan amount as early repayment fee.

7. Mortgage Types:
   - Fixed-rate mortgages: EMI remains constant for the fixed period.
   - Variable-rate mortgages: EMI may change depending on EIBOR rates.
